## Setup API Requirements

* _Create a file in the top level of your project directory called .env (hidden file) to hold our API key. This is a common file extension for a configuration file used to set up environmental variables. Paste your API key in your .env file that you just created and store it in an exported property named apiKey._

* _API key .env file example:_
**exports.apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY-GOES-HERE";**
